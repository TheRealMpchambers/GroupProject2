Round Robin Cabin Scheduler

Purpose of the app: To assist with scheduling time at the cabin between multiple family members.  This will inform the family member (via email) whose turn it is to select their week at the cabin.  It will also show who is on deck for selecting next.  Once a person chooses their date selection, they will be moved to the bottom of the list.  Names will be rotated through until there is either no dates left on the calender or everyone has "opted out" of choosing more dates.
